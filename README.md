# 🎯 Object-Oriented Programming in Java

## 🌟 Introduction
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java**!

🚀 It includes examples of key OOP concepts like **classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism** with simple implementations.

## 📌 What This Project Covers
✅ **Classes & Objects** – Creating and using objects

✅ **Encapsulation** – Protecting data with getters and setters

✅ **Inheritance** – Establishing parent-child relationships

✅ **Polymorphism** – Implementing method overloading & overriding

✅ **Basic Exception Handling** – Managing errors in Java

## 🛠️ Project Details
I have written Java programs to demonstrate the following:
- **Encapsulation**: Using private fields and public methods
- **Inheritance**: Creating subclasses that inherit properties
- **Polymorphism**: Implementing method overloading and overriding
- **Exception Handling**: Handling errors properly in Java

## 🏗️ Project Structure
📂 **src/** – Contains Java files for OOP concepts:
- `Example.java` (Basic OOP concepts)
- `Encapsulation.java`
- `Inheritance.java`
- `Polymorphism.java`

## 🔎 Notes
📝 This project serves as a **learning exercise**.
💡 The code is simple and beginner-friendly, making it easy to understand OOP concepts.
